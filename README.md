Hi there, I'm Abdul Saboor! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Computer Science student at PAF-KIET with a passion for Artificial Intelligence and Web Development. 
I love tackling challenges and turning them into learning opportunities. I've worked on projects like an image processing system, an AI-based Othello game,
a C# music player app, and a secure voting system.
My skills include Mern Stack, C#, Python, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MySQL, and MongoDB. 
Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects!.
